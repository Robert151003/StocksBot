    "This section focuses on the initial setup, data acquisition, and the core logic for generating trading signals based on candlestick reversal patterns. It covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Data Download**: Downloads 15-minute candlestick data for the EUR/USD forex pair using Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "-   **Pattern Detection Logic (`signal_generator`)**: Defines a Python function to identify specific candlestick reversal patterns. The patterns currently implemented are:\n",
    "    -   **Bullish Engulfing**: A strong reversal pattern indicating a potential price increase (Buy Signal).\n",
    "    -   **Bearish Engulfing**: A strong reversal pattern indicating a potential price decrease (Sell Signal).\n",
    "    -   **Morning Star**: A three-candle bullish reversal pattern (Buy Signal).\n",
    "    -   **Three White Soldiers**: A strong bullish reversal/continuation pattern over four candles (Buy Signal).\n",
    "    -   **Doji**: A neutral candle indicating indecision (No Pattern/No Trade).\n",
    "-   **Signal Generation**: Applies the `signal_generator` function across the downloaded dataset to create a new `signal` column.\n",
    "    -   `0` = No pattern detected\n",
    "    -   `1` = Buy signal\n",
    "    -   `2` = Sell signal\n",
    "-   **Output Utilization**: The generated `signal` column can be used for backtesting trading strategies or as an input for an automated trading system.\n"

    "-   **Data Acquisition**: Implements a `get_candles` function to retrieve live candlestick data for EUR/USD from OANDA.\n",

    "    -   Converts the live candle data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",

    "    -   Calculates **Take Profit (TP)** and **Stop Loss (SL)** levels dynamically based on recent price action to manage risk.\n",
    "    -   Places market orders (buy or sell) with attached TP/SL orders via the OANDA API if an actionable signal is detected.\n",

    "    -   Includes robust error handling, triggering an `emergency_stop` in case of critical failures.\n",
    "-   **Emergency Stop**: Provides `close_all_positions` and `emergency_stop` functions to immediately close any open positions and shut down the trading bot, offering a critical safety mechanism.\n",
    "-   **Scheduling**: Utilizes `APScheduler` to run the `trading_job` automatically at predefined intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes for 'M5' trading interval) during weekdays.\n",
    "-   **Interactive Control**: Presents an \"EMERGENCY STOP\" button using `ipywidgets` for manual intervention to stop the bot and close all positions instantly."

The frequency of execution (`minute` setting) is dynamically determined based on the `TRADING_INTERVAL` environment variable (e.g., every 5 minutes for 'M5' candles).\n",
